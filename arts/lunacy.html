                <h2>LUNACY</h2>
                <p class="subtitle">2020, 12” x 12”, 55 hours <br> Graphite and charcoal </p>
                <p>With wide, light-colored eyes ablaze with frenetic thoughts, <br> One reason I adore making old people is because of my granddad who wasn’t around for much long. In this portrait, I often times see a reflection of him. I have never gotten to know him in person yet I know that he was an iconoclast of his time. The man in the sketch is thin and has a chiseled appearance, coupled with pronounced wrinkles, and he speaks of a life lived with depth and intensity. "Lunacy" suggests an element of unconventional thinking or non-conformity, reflecting my granddad's disposition as a trailblazer or someone unafraid to challenge societal norms. The man’s posture and expression evoke a spirit of iconoclasm and even madness—a celebration of independent thinking and the courage to chart one's own course in life. <br> Yet, the distinction is somewhat haunting. The man also seems consumed by the labyrinth of his mind. Madness exudes from his penetrating stare, embodying a tormented thinker confounded by his own cogitations. The portrayal evokes a visceral sense of mental conflict, where the thin line between contemplation and madness blurs, revealing ways in which a man can spiral into the depths of his own intellect.
