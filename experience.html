         <p class="font1"> Team SHIRETO is a startup project at Thapathali Campus. The team works on research and development of electric vehicle catered for the nepalese transportation requirements and regularly participate in the events organized by SHELL. The autonomous division was created to study the applications of Artificial Intelligence and control systems to make the electric vehicles autonomous. I led this division from 2021 to 2022 which consisted of other 4 students. We mostly studied the path optimization for mobile robots and computer vision technologies. Execution of our work was mostly limited to simulations in ROS and MATLAB due to financial constraints.

         <h2 class="font1">4. Novel Fuzzy Logic controller With Acceleration as an Input Variable </h2>

         <p class="font1"> This research was the part of my Final year project which was a requirement for my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. The research was supervised by Mr Subodh Kumar Ghimire who is the former Head of Department of the Mechanical and Automobile Engineering Department. This research studied the inclusion of motor acceleration as an input variable     (along with angle and velocity) for a Fuzzy Logic Controller. This study was Novel in a way that it studied the affects of inclusion of the acceleration variable for a 3 DOF spatial robot manipulator. This study also studied and compared the performances of the FLC with the PID controller in situations of external vibrations and sensor noise. The work was presented in the thesis' Comparative Analysis of Fuzzy Logic and PID controller for trajectory control'
