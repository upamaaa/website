    <h4>Artist's Statement:</h4>
    <p>
      Often at odds with the status quo, I have found art to be liberatingâ€”in catalyzing the lives of our own and those around us. In art, I have sought the highest knowledge in the realms of beauty and philosophy. I am told that the nuances between proficiency and profoundness are subtle. <br>  Thus, in all my indulgences as an artist, I have strived to challenge myself with techniques, mediums, concepts but more with invoking emotions and thoughts. Through each brushstroke, I seek to unveil the enduring sentiments, unspoken narratives, and the profound subtleties that define the shared human condition. It is my belief that to experience the beauty of our existence is the only way to happiness. My intention as an artist is to share that beauty.
